# JW App

This repo contains a small demo that serves some verses from the **New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures** and a simple React interface.  The server is a Node/Express application and the frontend uses Vite.

## Installation

### Server
1. Install dependencies from the repository root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

### Frontend
1. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Extracting the NWT data
The repository only contains a sample chapter (`nwt-source/genesis.txt`).  If you have the full NWT PDF, copy it to `nwt-source/nwt.pdf` and run:
```bash
node extract-nwt.cjs
```
This creates `nwt-raw.json` with the raw lines from the PDF.

To structure the Genesis text into JSON required by the server run:
```bash
node extract-genesis.cjs
```
The result will be placed in `nwt-source/genesis.json`.

## Running the app
1. Start the server (defaults to port `4000`):
   ```bash
   node server.cjs
   ```
2. In another terminal start the React development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
The frontend will proxy API calls to the backend so both servers must be running.
