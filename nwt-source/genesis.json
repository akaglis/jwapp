      "3": "And God said: “Let there be light.” Then there was light. 4 After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.",
      "6": "Then God said: “Let there be an expanse between the waters, and let there be a division between the waters and the waters.” 7 Then God went on to make the expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the expanse. And it was so. 8 God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.",
      "9": "Then God said: “Let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. 10 God called the dry land Earth, but the collecting of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 11 Then God said: “Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.” And it was so. 12 And the earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plants and trees yielding fruit along with seed, according to their kinds. Then God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.",
      "14": "Then God said: “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night, and they will serve as signs for seasons and for days and years. 15 They will serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.” And it was so. 16 And God went on to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars. 17 Thus God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth 18 and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light and the darkness. Then God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.",
      "20": "Then God said: “Let the waters swarm with living creatures, and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.” 21 And God created the great sea creatures and all living creatures that move and swarm in the waters according to their kinds and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 With that God blessed them, saying: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the waters of the sea, and let the flying creatures become many in the earth.” 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.",
      "24": "Then God said: “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds, domestic animals and creeping animals and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. 25 And God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds and the domestic animals according to their kinds and all the creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.",
      "26": "Then God said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.” 27 And God went on to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. 28 Further, God blessed them, and God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.”",
      "29": "Then God said: “Here I have given to you every seed-bearing plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. Let them serve as food for you. 30 And to every wild animal of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in which there is life, I have given all green vegetation for food.” And it was so.",

      "5": "No bush of the field was yet on the earth and no vegetation of the field had begun sprouting, because Jehovah God had not made it rain on the earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground. 6 But a mist would go up from the earth, and it watered the entire surface of the ground.",
      "7": "And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person. 8 Further, Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, toward the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.",
      "10": "Now there was a river flowing out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four rivers. 11 The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 The gold of that land is good. Bdellium gum and onyx stone are also there. 13 The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush. 14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one going to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.",
      "15": "Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it and to take care of it. 16 Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. 17 But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.”",
      "18": "Then Jehovah God said: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.” 19 Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call each living creature, that became its name. 20 So the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him. 21 So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. 22 And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.",
      "23": "Then the man said:",
      "24": "That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh. 25 And both of them continued to be naked, the man and his wife; yet they were not ashamed."

      "1": "Now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of the field that Jehovah God had made. So it said to the woman: “Did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” 2 At this the woman said to the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden. 3 But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden: ‘You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’” 4 At this the serpent said to the woman: “You certainly will not die. 5 For God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.”",
      "6": "Consequently, the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something desirable to the eyes, yes, the tree was pleasing to look at. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward, she also gave some to her husband when he was with her, and he began eating it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves.",
      "8": "Later they heard the voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden about the breezy part of the day, and the man and his wife hid from the face of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden. 9 And Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to him: “Where are you?” 10 Finally he said: “I heard your voice in the garden, but I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.” 11 At that he said: “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?” 12 The man said: “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate.” 13 Jehovah God then said to the woman: “What is this you have done?” The woman replied: “The serpent deceived me, so I ate.”",
      "14": "Then Jehovah God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you are the cursed one out of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild animals of the field. On your belly you will go, and you will eat dust all the days of your life. 15 And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike him in the heel.”",
      "16": "To the woman he said: “I will greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in pain you will give birth to children, and your longing will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.”",
      "17": "And to Adam he said: “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate from the tree concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life. 18 It will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you must eat the vegetation of the field. 19 In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”",
      "20": "After this Adam named his wife Eve, because she was to become the mother of everyone living. 21 And Jehovah God made long garments from skins for Adam and for his wife, to clothe them. 22 Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad. Now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever,—” 23 With that Jehovah God expelled him from the garden of Eden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken. 24 So he drove the man out, and he posted at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning continuously to guard the way to the tree of life."

      "1": "Now Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said: “I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah.” 2 Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel.",
      "8": "After that Cain said to his brother Abel: “Let us go over into the field.” So while they were in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him. 9 Later on, Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is your brother Abel?” and he said: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?” 10 At this He said: “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground. 11 And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 12 When you cultivate the ground, it will not give you back its produce. You will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth.” 13 At this Cain said to Jehovah: “The punishment for my error is too great to bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your face; and I will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me.” 15 So Jehovah said to him: “For that reason, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times.”",
      "17": "Afterward Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Then he engaged in building a city and named the city after his son Enoch. 18 Later Irad was born to Enoch.

He was the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. 21 His brother’s name was Jubal. He was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe. 22 Also, Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, who forged every sort of tool of copper and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 23 Then Lamech composed these words for his wives Adah and Zillah:",

She named him Seth because, as she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” 26 There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah."

So Jehovah said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground on man’s account, for the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up; and never again will I strike down every living thing as I have done. 22 From now on, the earth will never cease to have seed-sowing and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night.”"

Please, separate from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; but if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.” 10 So Lot raised his eyes and saw that the whole district of the Jordan was a well-watered region (before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah), like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as far as Zoar. 11 Then Lot chose for himself the whole district of the Jordan, and Lot moved his camp to the east.

Now we are going to do worse to you than to them.” And they crowded in on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. 10 So the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and they shut the door. 11 But they struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, from the least to the greatest, so that they wore themselves out trying to find the doorway.",
      "12": "Then the men said to Lot: “Do you have anyone else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and all your people in the city, bring out of this place! 13 For we are going to destroy this place, because the outcry against them has indeed grown great before Jehovah, so that Jehovah sent us to destroy the city.” 14 So Lot went out and began to speak to his sons-in-law who were to marry his daughters, and he kept saying: “Get up! Get out of this place, because Jehovah will destroy the city!” But to his sons-in-law, he seemed to be joking.",
      "15": "As dawn was breaking, the angels became urgent with Lot, saying: “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here with you, so that you will not be swept away in the error of the city!” 16 When he kept lingering, then because of Jehovah’s compassion for him, the men seized hold of his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, and they brought him out and stationed him outside the city. 17 As soon as they had brought them to the outskirts, he said: “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you and do not stand still in any part of the district! Escape to the mountainous region so that you may not be swept away!”",
      "18": "Then Lot said to them: “Not there, please, Jehovah! 19 Please, now, your servant has found favor in your eyes and you are showing great kindness to me by preserving me alive, but I am not able to flee to the mountainous region because I am afraid that disaster may overtake me and I will die. 20 Please, now, this town is nearby and I can flee there; it is only a small place. May I, please, escape there? It is only a small place. Then I will survive.” 21 So he said to him: “Very well, I will also show you consideration by not overthrowing the town you speak of. 22 Hurry! Escape there, because I cannot do anything until you arrive there!” That is why he named the town Zoar.",
      "23": "The sun had risen over the land when Lot arrived at Zoar. 24 Then Jehovah made it rain sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah—it came from Jehovah, from the heavens. 25 So he overthrew these cities, yes, the entire district, including all the inhabitants of the cities and the plants of the ground. 26 But Lot’s wife, who was behind him, began to look back, and she became a pillar of salt.",
      "27": "Now Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Jehovah. 28 When he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the district, he saw quite a sight. There was dense smoke rising from the land like the dense smoke of a kiln! 29 So when God destroyed the cities of the district, God kept Abraham in mind by sending Lot out from the cities he overthrew, the cities where Lot had been dwelling.",
      "30": "Later Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and began living in the mountainous region, because he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he began living in a cave with his two daughters. 31 And the firstborn said to the younger: “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the land to have relations with us according to the custom of the whole earth. 32 Come, let us give our father wine to drink, and let us lie down with him and preserve offspring from our father.”",
      "33": "So that night they kept giving their father wine to drink; then the firstborn went in and lay down with her father, but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up. 34 Then on the next day, the firstborn said to the younger: “Here I lay down with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink tonight also. Then you go in and lie down with him, and let us preserve offspring from our father.” 35 So that night also, they repeatedly gave their father wine to drink; then the younger went and lay down with him, but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up. 36 So both daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. 37 The firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today. 38 The younger also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today."

While he was residing at Gerar, 2 Abraham repeated concerning his wife Sarah: “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. 3 Afterward, God came by night to Abimelech in a dream and said to him: “Here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken, since she is married and belongs to another man.” 4 However, Abimelech had not gone near her. So he said: “Jehovah, will you kill a nation that is really innocent? 5 Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and did she too not say, ‘He is my brother’? I did this with an honest heart and innocent hands.” 6 Then the true God said to him in the dream: “I know that you did this with an honest heart, so I held you back from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her. 7 Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will make supplication for you and you will keep living. But if you are not returning her, know that you will surely die, you and all who are yours.”",
      "8": "Abimelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things, and they became very frightened. 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him: “What have you done to us? What sin have I committed against you that you would bring upon me and my kingdom such a great sin? What you have done to me was not right.” 10 And Abimelech went on to say to Abraham: “What were your intentions when you did this thing?” 11 Abraham said: “It was because I said to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ 12 And besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. 13 So when God caused me to wander from the house of my father, I said to her: ‘Let this be how you show loyal love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”",
      "14": "Abimelech then took sheep and cattle and male and female servants and gave them to Abraham, and he returned his wife Sarah to him. 15 Abimelech also said: “Here my land is available to you. Dwell wherever you please.” 16 And to Sarah he said: “Here I give 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother. It is a sign of your innocence to all who are with you and before everybody, and you are cleared of reproach.” 17 And Abraham began to make supplication to the true God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his slave girls, and they began having children; 18 for Jehovah had made all the women of the house of Abimelech barren because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife."

Yet, I have given birth to a son for him in his old age.”",
      "8": "Now the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham prepared a big feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 9 But Sarah kept noticing that the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, was mocking Isaac. 10 So she said to Abraham: “Drive out this slave girl and her son, for the son of this slave girl is not going to be an heir along with my son, with Isaac!” 11 But what she said about his son was very displeasing to Abraham. 12 Then God said to Abraham: “Do not be displeased by what Sarah is saying to you about the boy and about your slave girl. Listen to her, for what will be called your offspring will be through Isaac. 13 As for the son of the slave girl, I will also make a nation out of him, because he is your offspring.”",
      "14": "So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin bottle of water and gave it to Hagar. He set these on her shoulder and then sent her away along with the boy. So she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 15 Finally the water in the skin bottle was used up, and she pushed the boy under one of the bushes. 16 Then she went on and sat down by herself, about the distance of a bowshot away, because she said: “I do not want to watch the boy die.” So she sat down at a distance and began to cry aloud and to weep.",
      "17": "At that God heard the voice of the boy, and God’s angel called to Hagar from the heavens and said to her: “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy there where he is. 18 Get up, lift the boy and take hold of him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 19 Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled the skin bottle with water and gave the boy a drink. 20 And God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer. 21 He took up dwelling in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.",

      "25": "However, Abraham complained to Abimelech about the well of water that the servants of Abimelech had violently seized. 26 Abimelech replied: “I do not know who did this; you did not tell me about it, and I heard nothing about it until today.” 27 At that Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. 28 When Abraham set seven female lambs apart from the flock by themselves, 29 Abimelech said to Abraham: “Why have you set these seven female lambs here by themselves?” 30 Then he said: “You are to accept the seven female lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.” 31 That is why he called that place Beer-sheba, because there both of them had taken an oath. 32 So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba, after which Abimelech got up together with Phicol the chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. 33 After that he planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba, and there he called on the name of Jehovah, the everlasting God. 34 And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time."

Give me a property to serve as a burial place in your midst so that I may remove my dead for burial.” 5 At this the sons of Heth answered Abraham: 6 “Hear us, my lord.

She went down to the spring, filled her water jar, and then came back up. 17 At once the servant ran to meet her and said: “Please give me a little sip of water from your jar.” 18 In turn she said: “Drink, my lord.” With that she quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink. 19 When she finished giving him a drink, she said: “I will also draw water for your camels until they are done drinking.” 20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the drinking trough and ran again and again to the well to draw water, and she kept drawing water for all his camels. 21 The whole time the man silently stared at her in amazement, wondering whether Jehovah had made his trip successful or not.",

Why do you keep standing out here? I have made the house ready and a place for the camels.” 32 With that the man came into the house, and he unharnessed the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 33 However, when something to eat was set before him, he said: “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.” So Laban said: “Speak!”",

What use is a birthright to me?” 33 And Jacob added: “Swear to me first!” So he swore to him and sold his right as firstborn to Jacob. 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and he got up and went away. Thus Esau despised the birthright."

Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” At this Isaac said to him: “I said it for fear I should die because of her.” 10 But Abimelech continued: “What have you done to us? One of the people could easily have lain down with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us!” 11 Then Abimelech commanded all the people, saying: “Anybody touching this man and his wife will surely be put to death!”",

      "15": "So the Philistines took soil and stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham. 16 Abimelech then said to Isaac: “Move from our neighborhood, for you have grown far stronger than we are.” 17 So Isaac moved from there and encamped in the valley of Gerar and began dwelling there. 18 And Isaac again dug the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham but that the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham’s death, and he called them by the names that his father had given them.",

So he named it Sitnah. 22 Later he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it. So he named it Rehoboth and said: “It is because now Jehovah has given us ample room and has made us fruitful in the land.”",

So we said, ‘Let there, please, be an oath of obligation between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you 29 that you will do nothing bad to us just as we have not harmed you, seeing that we have done only good to you in that we sent you away in peace. You now are the blessed of Jehovah.’” 30 Then he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. 31 In the morning they got up early and swore an oath to each other. After that Isaac sent them away, and they went from him in peace.",

Then let me eat so that I may bless you before Jehovah before my death.’ 8 And now, my son, listen carefully and do what I am instructing you. 9 Go, please, to the herd and get me two of the best young goats from there so that I may prepare from them a tasty dish for your father, just the way he likes it. 10 Then take it to your father to eat, in order that he may bless you before his death.”",

Just do as I say and go, get them for me.” 14 So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made a tasty dish, just the way his father liked it. 15 After that Rebekah took her older son Esau’s finest garments, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 16 She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the hairless part of his neck. 17 Then she handed the tasty dish and the bread that she had made to her son Jacob.",

I would stand the loss of it myself. Whether the animal was stolen by day or was stolen by night, you would demand compensation from me. 40 By day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and sleep would flee from my eyes. 41 This makes 20 years for me in your house. I have served you 14 years for your two daughters and 6 years for your flock, and you kept changing my wages ten times. 42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the One whom Isaac fears, had not been on my side, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and that is why he reproved you last night.”",
      "43": "Then Laban answered Jacob: “The daughters are my daughters and the children my children and the flock my flock, and everything you are looking at is mine and my daughters’. What can I do today against these or against their children whom they have borne? 44 Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and it will serve as a witness between us.” 45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. 46 Then Jacob said to his brothers: “Pick up stones!” And they took stones and made a pile. After that they ate there on the pile of stones. 47 And Laban began calling it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.",
      "48": "Laban then said: “This pile of stones is a witness between me and you today.” That is why he named it Galeed, 49 and the Watchtower, for he said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between you and me when we are out of each other’s sight. 50 If you mistreat my daughters and if you start taking wives in addition to my daughters, though there is no man with us, remember that God will be a witness between you and me.” 51 Laban went on to say to Jacob: “Here is this pile of stones, and here is the pillar that I have erected between you and me. 52 This pile of stones is a witness, and the pillar is something that bears witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones to bring harm to you and you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to bring harm to me. 53 Let the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the One whom his father Isaac fears.",
      "54": "After that Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and invited his brothers to eat bread. So they ate and spent the night in the mountain. 55 However, Laban got up early in the morning and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home."

      "3": "Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the territory of Edom, 4 and he commanded them: “This is what you will say to my lord, to Esau, ‘This is what your servant Jacob says: “I have resided with Laban for a long time until now. 5 And I have acquired bulls, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants, and I send this message to inform my lord, in order to find favor in your eyes.”’”",
      "6": "In time the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: “We met your brother Esau, and he is now on his way to meet you, and there are 400 men with him.” 7 And Jacob became very frightened and anxious. So he divided the people who were with him, as well as the flocks, the cattle, and the camels, into two camps. 8 He said: “If Esau attacks the one camp, then the other camp will be able to escape.”",
      "9": "After that Jacob said: “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you who are saying to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I will deal well with you,’ 10 I am unworthy of all the loyal love and of all the faithfulness that you have shown toward your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two camps. 11 Save me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid of him that he may come and attack me, as well as the mothers and their children. 12 And you have said: ‘I will certainly deal well with you, and I will make your offspring like the grains of sand of the sea, which are too numerous to count.’”",
      "13": "And he spent the night there. Then he took some of his possessions as a gift for Esau his brother: 14 200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 female sheep, 20 rams, 15 30 camels nursing their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 full-grown male donkeys.",
      "16": "He handed them over to his servants, one drove after another, and he said to his servants: “Cross over ahead of me, and you are to set a space between one drove and the next.” 17 He also commanded the first one: “In case Esau my brother should meet you and ask, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?’ 18 then you should say, ‘To your servant Jacob. It is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau, and look! he himself is also behind us.’” 19 And he commanded also the second, the third, and all those following the droves: “According to this word, you are to speak to Esau when you meet him. 20 And you should also say, ‘Here is your servant Jacob behind us.’” For he said to himself: ‘If I appease him by sending a gift ahead of me, then afterward when I see him, he may give me a kindly reception.’ 21 So the gift crossed over ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.",
      "22": "Later during that night, he rose and took his two wives and his two female servants and his 11 young sons and crossed over the ford of Jabbok. 23 So he took them and brought them across the stream, and he brought over everything else he had.",
      "24": "Finally Jacob was left by himself. Then a man began to wrestle with him until the dawn broke. 25 When he saw that he had not prevailed over him, he touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated during his wrestling with him. 26 After that he said: “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” To this he said: “I am not going to let you go until you bless me.” 27 So he said to him: “What is your name?” to which he said: “Jacob.” 28 Then he said: “Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel, for you have contended with God and with men and you have at last prevailed.” 29 In turn Jacob inquired: “Tell me, please, your name.” However, he said: “Why is it that you ask my name?” With that he blessed him there. 30 So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, “I have seen God face-to-face, yet my life was preserved.”",
      "31": "And the sun rose upon him as soon as he passed by Penuel, but he was limping because of his hip. 32 That is why to this day the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the thigh sinew, which is on the socket of the hip joint, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip joint by the thigh sinew."

So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants. 2 He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them. 3 Then he himself went ahead of them and bowed down to the earth seven times as he came near to his brother.",
      "4": "But Esau ran to meet him, and he embraced him and kissed him, and they burst into tears. 5 When he raised his eyes and saw the women and the children, he said: “Who are these with you?” to which he said: “The children with whom God has favored your servant.” 6 At that the female servants came forward with their children and bowed down, 7 and Leah too came forward with her children, and they bowed down. Then Joseph came forward with Rachel, and they bowed down.",
      "8": "Esau said: “What is the purpose of all this camp of travelers that I have met?” He replied: “In order to find favor in the eyes of my lord.” 9 Then Esau said: “I have a great many possessions, my brother. Keep what is yours.” 10 However, Jacob said: “No, please. If I have found favor in your eyes, you must take my gift from my hand, because I brought it so that I could see your face. And I have seen your face as though seeing God’s face, in that you received me with pleasure. 11 Take, please, the gift conveying my blessing that was brought to you, for God has favored me and I have everything I need.” And he continued to urge him, so that he took it.",
      "12": "Later Esau said: “Let us move out and go, and let me go in advance of you.” 13 But he said to him: “My lord is aware that the children are delicate and that in my care are sheep and cattle nursing their young. If they are driven too quickly for one day, then the whole flock will die. 14 Let my lord, please, go on ahead of his servant, but I will continue the journey more slowly at the pace of my livestock and of the children until I come to my lord at Seir.” 15 Then Esau said: “Please, let me leave some of my people with you.” To this he said: “Why do this? Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.” 16 So that day Esau went on his way back to Seir.",

      "18": "After journeying from Paddan-aram, Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he set up his camp near the city. 19 Then he acquired a portion of the field where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for 100 pieces of money. 20 There he set up an altar and called it God, the God of Israel."

      "5": "When Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his herd in the field. So Jacob kept silent until they returned. 6 Later Hamor, Shechem’s father, went out to speak with Jacob. 7 But the sons of Jacob heard about it and returned from the field right away. They were offended and very angry because he had disgraced Israel by lying down with Jacob’s daughter, something that should not be done.",
      "8": "Hamor spoke with them, saying: “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife, 9 and form marriage alliances with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves. 10 You may dwell with us, and the land will become available for you. Dwell and carry on trade in it and settle in it.” 11 Then Shechem said to her father and to her brothers: “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask me. 12 You can demand from me a very high bride price and gift. I am willing to give whatever you may say to me. Just give me the young woman as a wife.”",
      "13": "And Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully because he had defiled Dinah their sister. 14 They said to them: “We cannot possibly do such a thing, to give our sister to a man who is not circumcised, for that is a disgrace to us. 15 We can only consent on this condition: that you become like us and circumcise all your males. 16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people. 17 But if you do not listen to us and get circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”",
      "18": "Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. 19 The young man did not delay in doing what they asked, because he found delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was the most honorable of the whole house of his father.",

We can take their daughters as wives, and our daughters we can give to them. 22 Only on this one condition will the men consent to dwell with us in order to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised just the way they are circumcised. 23 Then, will not their possessions, their wealth, and all their livestock be ours? So let us give them our consent that they may dwell with us.” 24 All those going out by the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and all the males got circumcised, all those going out of the city gate.",
      "25": "However, on the third day, when they were still in pain, two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and went into the unsuspecting city and killed every male. 26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and then took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left. 27 Jacob’s other sons came upon the slain men and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister. 28 They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field. 29 They also took all their possessions, captured all their little children and their wives, and plundered everything in the houses.",
      "30": "At this Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi: “You have brought great trouble on me in making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land, to the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number, and they will certainly gather together to attack me and I will be annihilated, I and my house.” 31 But they said: “Should anyone treat our sister like a prostitute?”"

There I will make an altar to the true God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.” 4 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the big tree that was close to Shechem.",
      "5": "When they traveled on, the terror of God struck the cities around them, so they did not chase after the sons of Jacob. 6 Jacob eventually came to Luz, that is, Bethel, in the land of Canaan, he and all the people with him. 7 There he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there the true God had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother. 8 Later Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried at the foot of Bethel under an oak.

Nations and a congregation of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you. 12 As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your offspring after you I will give the land.” 13 Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.",

However, she said: “What will you give me that you may have relations with me?” 17 To this he said: “I will send a young goat from my herd.” But she said: “Will you give a security until you send it?” 18 He continued: “What security should I give you?” to which she said: “Your seal ring and your cord and your rod that is in your hand.” Then he gave them to her and had relations with her, and she became pregnant by him. 19 After that she got up and went away and removed her shawl and clothed herself with her widow’s clothing.",
      "20": "And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his companion the Adullamite, to get back the security from the hand of the woman, but he never found her. 21 He inquired of the men of her place, saying: “Where is that temple prostitute in Enaim along the road?” But they said: “No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.” 22 Finally he returned to Judah and said: “I never found her, and besides, the men of the place said, ‘No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.’” 23 So Judah said: “Let her take them for herself, in order that we may not fall into contempt. At any rate, I have sent this young goat, but you never found her.”",
      "24": "However, about three months later, Judah was told: “Tamar your daughter-in-law has acted as a prostitute, and she is also pregnant by her prostitution.” At that Judah said: “Bring her out and let her be burned.” 25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong.” Then she added: “Please examine to whom these belong, the seal ring and the cord and the rod.” 26 Then Judah examined them and said: “She is more righteous than I am, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.” And he had no further sexual relations with her after that.",
      "27": "When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb. 28 As she was giving birth, one put out his hand, and the midwife immediately took a scarlet thread and tied it around his hand, saying: “This one came out first.” 29 But as soon as he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she exclaimed: “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So he was named Perez. 30 Afterward his brother came out, around whose hand the scarlet thread was tied, and he was named Zerah."

As a result, he became successful and was put over the house of his master, the Egyptian. 3 And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah was making everything that he did successful.",
      "4": "Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes, and he became his personal attendant. So he appointed him over his house, and he put him in charge of all that was his. 5 From the time he appointed him over his house and in charge of all that was his, Jehovah kept blessing the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph, and Jehovah’s blessing came to be on all that he had in the house and in the field. 6 He eventually left everything that was his in Joseph’s care, and he gave no thought to anything except the food he was eating. Moreover, Joseph grew to be well-built and handsome.",
      "7": "Now after these things, the wife of his master began to cast her eyes on Joseph and say: “Lie down with me.” 8 But he refused and said to his master’s wife: “Here my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has entrusted everything he has into my care. 9 There is no one greater in this house than I am, and he has not withheld from me anything at all except you, because you are his wife. So how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?”",
      "10": "So day after day she spoke to Joseph, but he never consented to lie with her or to remain with her. 11 But on one of the days when he went into the house to do his work, none of the household servants were in the house. 12 Then she grabbed hold of him by his garment and said: “Lie down with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and fled outside. 13 As soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, 14 she began to cry out to the men of her house and to say to them: “Look! He brought to us this Hebrew man to make us a laughingstock. He came to me to lie down with me, but I began to cry out at the top of my voice. 15 Then as soon as he heard me raising my voice and screaming, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.” 16 After that she laid his garment beside her until his master came to his house.",
      "17": "Then she told him the same thing, saying: “The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came to me to make me a laughingstock. 18 But as soon as I raised my voice and began to scream, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.” 19 As soon as his master heard the words his wife spoke to him, saying: “These are the things your servant did to me,” his anger blazed. 20 So Joseph’s master took him and gave him over to the prison, the place where the prisoners of the king were kept under arrest, and he remained there in the prison.",
      "21": "But Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him and granting him favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison. 22 So the chief officer of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners in the prison, and everything that they were doing there, he was the one having it done. 23 The chief officer of the prison was looking after absolutely nothing that was in Joseph’s care, for Jehovah was with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful."

      "5": "The cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own interpretation. 6 The next morning, when Joseph came in and saw them, they looked dejected. 7 So he asked the officers of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house: “Why are your faces gloomy today?” 8 At this they said to him: “We each had a dream, but there is no interpreter with us.” Joseph said to them: “Do not interpretations belong to God? Relate it to me, please.”",
      "9": "So the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, saying to him: “In my dream, there was a vine before me. 10 And on the vine, there were three twigs, and as it was sprouting shoots, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. 11 And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them out into Pharaoh’s cup. After that I put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.” 12 Then Joseph said to him: “This is its interpretation: The three twigs are three days. 13 Three days from now, Pharaoh will bring you out, restoring you to your office, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cupbearer. 14 Nevertheless, you must remember me when things go well with you. Please show me loyal love and mention me to Pharaoh, in order to get me out of this place. 15 I was, in fact, kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I have not done anything here for which they should put me in prison.”",
      "16": "When the chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted something good, he said to him: “I too was in my dream, and there were three baskets of white bread on my head, 17 and in the top basket, there were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, and there were birds eating them out of the basket on top of my head.” 18 Then Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days. 19 Three days from now, Pharaoh will behead you and will hang you on a stake, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.”",
      "20": "Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he made a feast for all his servants, and he brought out both the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his servants. 21 And he returned the chief cupbearer to his post of cupbearer, and he continued to hand the cup to Pharaoh. 22 But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them. 23 However, the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he kept forgetting him."

At this Pharaoh woke up.",
      "5": "Then he went back to sleep and had a second dream. There were seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk, full and choice. 6 And growing up after them were seven ears of grain that were thin and scorched by the east wind. 7 And the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven full and choice ears of grain. At this Pharaoh woke up and realized that it was a dream.",
      "8": "But in the morning, his spirit became agitated. So he sent for all the magic-practicing priests of Egypt and all her wise men. Pharaoh related his dreams to them, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.",
      "9": "At that the chief cupbearer spoke with Pharaoh, saying: “I am confessing my sins today. 10 Pharaoh was indignant at his servants. So he committed me to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard, both me and the chief baker. 11 After that we each had a dream on the same night. He and I each had a dream with its own interpretation. 12 And there with us was a young Hebrew man, a servant of the chief of the guard. When we related them to him, he interpreted for us the meaning of each dream. 13 It happened exactly as he had interpreted to us. I was restored to my office, but the other man was hanged.”",
      "14": "So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him quickly from the prison. He shaved and changed his clothes and went in to Pharaoh. 15 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “I had a dream, but there is no one to interpret it. Now I have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it.” 16 At this Joseph answered Pharaoh: “I need not be considered! God will speak concerning Pharaoh’s welfare.”",

I have never seen such bad-looking cows in all the land of Egypt. 20 And the skinny, bad cows began to eat up the first seven fat cows. 21 But when they had consumed them, no one could have known that they had done so, since their appearance was just as bad as at the start. At that I woke up.",

So I told it to the magic-practicing priests, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”",
      "25": "Then Joseph said to Pharaoh: “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. The true God has told to Pharaoh what He will do. 26 The seven good cows are seven years. Likewise, the seven good ears of grain are seven years. The dreams are one and the same. 27 The seven skinny and bad cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, will prove to be seven years of famine. 28 This is just as I told to Pharaoh: The true God has caused Pharaoh to see what He will do.",
      "29": "“There are to be seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt. 30 But seven years of famine will certainly arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will certainly be forgotten, and the famine will exhaust the land. 31 And the previous abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine afterward, for it will be very severe. 32 The dream was given twice to Pharaoh because the matter has been firmly established by the true God, and the true God will soon carry it out.",
      "33": "“So now let Pharaoh look for a man who is discreet and wise and place him over the land of Egypt. 34 Let Pharaoh take action and appoint overseers in the land, and he should collect one fifth of the produce of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 35 And let them collect all the food during these coming good years, and let them stockpile grain under Pharaoh’s authority as food to be stored in the cities and safeguarded there. 36 The food should serve as a supply for the land for the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.”",
      "37": "This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and all his servants. 38 So Pharaoh said to his servants: “Can another man be found like this one in whom there is the spirit of God?” 39 Pharaoh then said to Joseph: “Since God has caused you to know all of this, there is no one as discreet and wise as you. 40 You will personally be over my house, and all my people will obey you implicitly. Only in my role as king will I be greater than you.” 41 And Pharaoh added to Joseph: “See, I am putting you over all the land of Egypt.” 42 Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph’s hand and clothed him with garments of fine linen and placed a necklace of gold around his neck. 43 Moreover, he had him ride in the second chariot of honor that he had, and they would call out ahead of him, “Avrékh!” Thus he put him over all the land of Egypt.",
      "44": "Pharaoh further said to Joseph: “I am Pharaoh, but without your authorization, no man may do a single thing in all the land of Egypt.” 45 After that Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On as a wife. And Joseph began to oversee the land of Egypt. 46 Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.",
      "50": "Before the year of the famine arrived, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On bore to him. 51 Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, for he said, “God has made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father.” 52 And he named the second one Ephraim, for he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”",
      "53": "Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt ended, 54 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. The famine developed in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 55 Eventually, all the land of Egypt suffered from the famine, and the people began to cry to Pharaoh for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians: “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.” 56 The famine continued over all the surface of the earth. Then Joseph began to open up all the granaries that were among them and to sell to the Egyptians, as the famine had a strong grip on the land of Egypt. 57 Moreover, people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy from Joseph, because the famine had a strong grip on all the earth."

Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may stay alive and not die.” 3 So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his other brothers, for he said: “Perhaps a fatal accident may befall him.”",
      "5": "So Israel’s sons came along with the others who were coming to buy, because the famine had extended to the land of Canaan. 6 Joseph was the man in authority over the land, and he was the one who sold grain to all the people of the earth. So Joseph’s brothers came and bowed low to him with their faces to the ground. 7 When Joseph saw his brothers, he immediately recognized them, but he concealed his identity from them. So he spoke harshly with them and said: “Where have you come from?” to which they said: “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”",
      "8": "Thus Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 9 Joseph immediately remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them: “You are spies! You have come to see the vulnerable areas of the land!” 10 Then they said to him: “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 11 We are all sons of but one man. We are upright men. Your servants do not act as spies.” 12 But he said to them: “Not so! You have come to see the vulnerable areas of the land!” 13 At this they said: “Your servants are 12 brothers. We are the sons of but one man in the land of Canaan, and the youngest is now with our father, whereas the other one is no more.”",
      "14": "However, Joseph said to them: “It is just as I said to you—‘You are spies!’ 15 By this you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here. 16 Send one of you to bring your brother while you remain in bondage. In this way, your words may be tested out to see if you are telling the truth. And if not, then, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies.” 17 With that he put them together in custody for three days.",

      "21": "And they said to one another: “We are surely being punished on account of our brother, because we saw his distress when he begged us to show compassion, but we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.” 22 Then Reuben answered them: “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not sin against the child,’ but you would not listen? Now his blood is certainly being asked back.” 23 But they did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them. 24 So he turned away from them and began to weep. When he returned and spoke to them again, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. 25 Joseph then gave the command to fill up their bags with grain and to return each man’s money to his own sack and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.",
      "26": "So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left from there. 27 When one of them opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place, he saw his money there in the mouth of his bag. 28 At that he said to his brothers: “My money has been returned, and now here it is in my bag!” Then their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another and said: “What is this that God has done to us?”",
      "29": "When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all the things that had befallen them, saying: 30 “The man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly with us and accused us of spying on the country. 31 But we said to him, ‘We are upright men. We are not spies. 32 We are 12 brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’ 33 But the man who is the lord of the country said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are upright: Leave one of your brothers with me. Then take something to alleviate the famine in your households and go. 34 And bring your youngest brother to me, so that I may know that you are not spies but upright men. I will then give your brother back to you, and you may carry on trade in the land.’”",
      "35": "As they were emptying their sacks, here was each one’s bag of money in his sack. When they and their father saw their bags of money, they became afraid. 36 Jacob their father exclaimed to them: “It is I you have bereaved! Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you are going to take Benjamin! It is upon me that all these things have come!” 37 But Reuben said to his father: “You may put to death my own two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Give him over to my care, and I will return him to you.” 38 However, he said: “My son will not go down with you, because his brother is dead and he alone is left.

Do you have another brother?’ and we told him these facts. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”",
      "8": "Judah then urged Israel his father: “Send the boy with me, and let us go on our way so that we may live and not die—we and you and our children. 9 I will be a guarantee for his safety. You may hold me responsible. If I fail to return him to you and present him to you, I will have sinned against you for all time. 10 But if we had not delayed, we could have been there and back twice by now.”",
      "11": "So Israel their father said to them: “If it must be so, then do this: Take the finest products of the land in your bags and carry them down to the man as a gift: a little balsam, a little honey, labdanum, resinous bark, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 12 Take double the money with you; and also take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your bags. Maybe it was a mistake. 13 Take your brother and go, return to the man. 14 May God Almighty grant you pity from the man, so that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. But as for me, if I must be bereaved, I will be bereaved!”",
      "15": "So the men took this gift, and they took double the money in their hand and Benjamin. Then they rose and went on their way down to Egypt and again stood before Joseph. 16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he at once said to the man who was over his house: “Take the men to the house and slaughter animals and prepare the meal, for the men are to eat with me at noon.” 17 Immediately the man did just as Joseph had said, and he took them to Joseph’s house. 18 But the men became afraid when they were taken to Joseph’s house, and they began to say: “It is because of the money that was returned in our bags the last time that we are being brought here. Now they will attack us and make us slaves and take our donkeys!”",
      "19": "So they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the entrance of the house. 20 They said: “Pardon us, my lord! We did come down the first time to buy food. 21 But when we arrived at our lodging place and began opening our bags, why, here was the money of each one in the mouth of his bag, our money in full weight. So we would like to return it personally. 22 And we have brought more money to buy food. We do not know who placed our money in our bags.” 23 Then he said: “It is all right. Do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father put treasure in your bags. Your money came first to me.” After that he brought out Simeon to them.",
      "24": "Then the man brought them into Joseph’s house and gave them water for washing their feet, and he gave fodder for their donkeys. 25 And they prepared the gift for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they were going to eat a meal there. 26 When Joseph went into the house, they brought their gift to him into the house and prostrated themselves to him to the ground. 27 After this he inquired about their welfare and said: “How is your aged father of whom you have spoken? Is he still alive?” 28 To this they said: “Your servant our father is well. He is still alive.” Then they bowed down and prostrated themselves.",
      "29": "When he looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, he said: “Is this your brother, the youngest one of whom you have spoken to me?” He added: “May God show you his favor, my son.” 30 Joseph then hurried out, because he was overcome with emotion for his brother, and he looked for a place to weep. So he went into a private room and gave way to tears there. 31 After that he washed his face and went out, now in control of himself, and he said: “Serve the meal.” 32 They served him by himself and them by themselves, and the Egyptians with him ate by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat a meal with the Hebrews, because that is a detestable thing to the Egyptians.",
      "33": "The brothers were seated before him, the firstborn according to his right as firstborn and the youngest according to his youth, and they kept looking at one another in amazement. 34 He kept sending portions of food from his table to theirs, but he increased Benjamin’s portion five times the size of the portions of all the others.

It is a wicked thing you have done.’”",

It is unthinkable that your servants would do anything like this. 8 Why, the money that we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How, then, could we steal silver or gold from the house of your master? 9 If it is found with one of your slaves, let him die, and the rest of us will also become slaves to my master.” 10 So he said: “Let it be as you say: The one with whom it is found will become my slave, but the rest of you will be innocent.” 11 With that each one quickly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it. 12 He searched carefully, starting with the oldest and finishing with the youngest. Finally the cup was found in Benjamin’s bag.",
      "13": "Then they ripped their garments apart, and each of them lifted his load back onto his donkey and returned to the city. 14 When Judah and his brothers went into Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him. 15 Joseph said to them: “What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man like me can expertly read omens?” 16 At this Judah replied: “What can we say to my master? What can we speak? And how can we prove ourselves righteous? The true God has found out the error of your slaves. We are now slaves to my master, both we and the one in whose hand the cup was found!” 17 However, he said: “It is unthinkable for me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found is the one who will become a slave to me. As for the rest of you, go up in peace to your father.”",
      "18": "Judah now approached him and said: “I beg you, my master, please let your slave speak a word in my master’s ears, and do not become angry with your slave, for you are like Pharaoh himself. 19 My master asked his slaves, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 20 So we said to my master, ‘We do have an aged father and a child of his old age, the youngest. But his brother is dead, so he is the only remaining son of his mother, and his father loves him.’ 21 After that you said to your slaves, ‘Bring him down to me so that I may see him.’ 22 But we said to my master, ‘The boy is not able to leave his father.

Why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out?” 16 Then Joseph said: “If your money has run out, hand over your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.” 17 So they began bringing their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph kept giving them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of the flock and of the herd, and the donkeys, and he kept providing them with food in exchange for all their livestock during that year.",

Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we together with our land will become slaves to Pharaoh.

Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land with it. 24 When it produces, give a fifth to Pharaoh, but four parts will be yours as seed for the field and as food for you and for those in your houses and for your children to eat.” 25 So they said: “You have preserved our lives. Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will become slaves to Pharaoh.” 26 Then Joseph made it a decree, which is valid until today over the land of Egypt, that a fifth belongs to Pharaoh.

Put your right hand on his head.” 19 But his father kept refusing and said: “I know it, my son, I know it. He too will become a people, and he too will become great.
